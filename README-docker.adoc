= WIP - This documentation needs updating

= Spinnaker + Docker

This document shows how to run a local version of Spinnaker inside a docker container.

== Docker

Got Docker? Docker is easiest to run if you have a Linux server sitting around. There are multiple virtual machines available.

NOTE: It's possible to run Docker from Mac OSX, but there are a lot of wrinkles involved. This document assumes you are simply using some virtual server, like VirtualBox or VMWare.

Assuming you are running a Linux server, install docker.

=== In Ubuntu

```
$ sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

== Building a docker image of this project

With Docker installed, you are ready to build a Docker image that you can.

```
$ sudo docker build -t ubuntu:spinnaker .
```

* `sudo` - Docker commands are run as root. On a Debian derivative, you use sudo to accomplish this
* `docker build` - build a Docker container using the Dockerfile
* `-t ubuntu:spinnaker` - tag repository:name, doesn't really matter. Just pick a distinct name
* `.` - look in the this local path for the `Dockerfile`

== Launching the container

Assuming you built the image, time to launch.

```
$ sudo docker run -i -p 80 -t ubuntu:spinnaker /bin/bash
```

* `-i` - launch in interactive mode (we need this so we can fire up the application)
* `-p 80` - expose the container's port 80 to the outside world (for the external port, see below)
* `-t ubuntu:spinnaker` - tagged image to run
* `/bin/bash` - The command it launches is your shell. You'll be *root* at `/`

WARNING: No server processes will have started.

== Running Spinnaker

Time to fire it up the actual application. (HINT: You are now inside the container.)

```
#/> /opt/run.sh
```

This will launch all the components needed for Spinnaker.

== Viewing Spinnaker from the outside world

If you type `exit` from that shell, you'll not only exit the container, but you'll shut it down as well. As an alternative, open a new shell tab in the host system. Then do this:

```
$ sudo docker ps
```

You should see something like this:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                   NAMES
99abb500ff0f        ubuntu:spinnaker    /bin/bash           5 seconds ago       Up 4 seconds        0.0.0.0:49153->80/tcp   jovial_heisenberg   
```

The *CONTAINER ID*, times, and *NAMES* will certainly be different. But notice the *PORTS* column. It says that if visit *localhost:49153*, it will forward that web request to the container's port *80*.

== Viewing Spinnaker from the original guest

Remember setting up Docker inside a virtual machine? If you have things configured properly, you can back up to your actual guest machine and see Spinnaker.

```
$ ifconfig -a
```

This should show the IP address of docker as well as the Linux server. Capture the Linux server's IP address.

Now go to actual guest operating system, and open a browser at *<ip address>:49153*. Ta dah!
